# hookfunction lua tutorial - full guide

## This is the ultimate guide to hookfunction in Lua, explaining how it works, how to use it effectively, and real examples!


---

# What is hookfunction?

# hookfunction is a powerful function used in Lua executors (mainly in Roblox) that allows you to override or modify existing functions at runtime.

# By using hookfunction, you can:
## Modify game functions without changing the source code.
## Redirect function calls to custom functions.
## Intercept and log data before returning original results.


---

# Basic Syntax of hookfunction

### The syntax is straightforward:

### local old_function = hookfunction(target_function, new_function)

### target_function: The original function you want to modify.

### new_function: Your custom function that replaces the original.

### old_function: Stores the original function (so you can call it if needed).



---

# Example 1: Hooking print() Function

modify print() to add [HOOKED] before every message!
```Lua
local old_print = hookfunction(print, function(...)
    old_print("[HOOKED] ", ...)
end)

print("Hello, world!") -- Output: [HOOKED] Hello, world!
```
This replaces the normal print() with a hooked version that adds a prefix.


---

# Example 2: Hooking a Game Function (Roblox)

hook game.HttpGet() to prevent HTTP requests:
```Lua
local old_HttpGet = hookfunction(game.HttpGet, function(self, url, ...)
    print("Blocked request to: " .. url)
    return old_HttpGet(self, "https://safe-url.com", ...) -- Redirect to a safe URL
end)
```
If a script tries to call game:HttpGet("https://example.com"), it gets blocked or redirected!



---

# Example 3: Hooking to Modify Game Behavior

change math.random() so it always returns 100:
```Lua
local old_random = hookfunction(math.random, function(...)
    return 100
end)

print(math.random(1, 10)) -- Output: 100
```
This overrides math.random() so no matter the input, it always returns 100.



---

# Example 4: Hooking a GUI Function in Roblox

modify TextLabel.Text so it always displays "modified!"
```Lua
local old_setText = hookfunction(game.TextLabel.SetText, function(self, text)
    return old_setText(self, "modified!") -- Force text to be "modified!"
end)
```
Any time a script sets a TextLabel's text, it gets changed!



---

# Example 5: Restoring the Original Function

If you ever need to restore the original function, just call old_function:
```Lua
hookfunction(print, old_print) -- Restore the original print function
print("This is back to normal!") -- Output: This is back to normal!
```

---

### When to Use hookfunction?

Modifying built-in functions in Lua.
Overriding game functions in Roblox/FiveM.
Logging or blocking specific function calls.
Redirecting or manipulating function outputs.


---

# Important Notes

hookfunction is only available in some Lua executors (e.g., Roblox exploits).

It does NOT exist in normal Lua (like vanilla Lua 5.1 or LuaJIT).

Always store the original function (old_function) in case you need to restore it.

# CONCLUSION: master hookfunction, scripter exploit and happy coding!

### With this tutorial, you now fully understand hookfunction and how to use it to modify Lua scripts dynamically, tutorial by ScripterMrbacon, you can modify the tutorial too or make it more better and easy to understand!

# ADVANCED hookfunction TUTORIAL - BLOCKING REMOTES, TOGGLING & BYPASSING ANTICHEAT

## This tutorial will go even deeper into hookfunction, showing how to block RemoteEvents, modify them, toggle hooks, and bypass anticheats!


---

# 1. Blocking RemoteEvent Calls

RemoteEvents in Roblox are used to send data between the client and server. If a game sends anti-cheat logs, we can block them using hookfunction.

Example: Block All RemoteEvent Calls
```Lua
local old_fireServer = hookfunction(game.ReplicatedStorage.RemoteEvent.FireServer, function(self, ...)
    print("Blocked RemoteEvent:", self.Name)
    return -- Prevent the event from firing
end)
```
This will block ALL RemoteEvents from being sent by the client.

Useful for stopping ban logs, damage reports, or cheat detections.



---

# 2. Modifying RemoteEvent Data

Instead of blocking, we can modify the data before it’s sent.

Example: Modify Damage Sent to Server
```Lua
local old_fireServer = hookfunction(game.ReplicatedStorage.DamageEvent.FireServer, function(self, damage, ...)
    print("Modified Damage: Sent 9999 instead of", damage)
    return old_fireServer(self, 9999, ...) -- Change damage to 9999
end)
```
If a game tries to send DamageEvent:FireServer(50), it will send 9999 instead!

Useful for making an undetectable damage exploit!



---

# 3. Hooking Remote Functions (InvokeServer)

RemoteFunctions allow the client to request data from the server. We can intercept and change the responses.

# Example: Always Get Maximum Money from a RemoteFunction
```Lua
local old_invokeServer = hookfunction(game.ReplicatedStorage.GetMoney.InvokeServer, function(self, ...)
    print("Hooked Money Request: Returning 9999999")
    return 9999999 -- Always return max money
end)
```
If the game calls GetMoney:InvokeServer(), it always returns 9999999!

Useful for faking money, bypassing currency checks, or getting admin privileges!



---

# 4. Making hookfunction Toggleable

We can add a toggle system so hooks can be turned on or off dynamically.

Example: Toggle Blocking RemoteEvents
```Lua
local toggle = true -- Change this to true/false to toggle

local old_fireServer = hookfunction(game.ReplicatedStorage.RemoteEvent.FireServer, function(self, ...)
    if toggle then
        print("Blocked RemoteEvent:", self.Name)
        return
    end
    return old_fireServer(self, ...) -- Run normally if toggle is false
end)

-- Toggle Example
task.spawn(function()
    while true do
        wait(5)
        toggle = not toggle -- Switch between true/false every 5 seconds
        print("Hook Toggle:", toggle and "ON" or "OFF")
    end
end)
```
This script toggles remote blocking every 5 seconds.

Press a GUI button or keybind to control it dynamically.



---

# 5. Bypassing Game Anticheat with hookfunction

Many games use anti-cheat functions that run in the background. We can hook them and disable them completely.

# Example: Disable isPlayerExploiting Check
```Lua
local old_check = hookfunction(game.AntiCheat.isPlayerExploiting, function(...)
    print("AntiCheat Bypassed!")
    return false -- Always return false (not exploiting)
end)
```
If the game calls isPlayerExploiting(), it always returns false, preventing bans.



---

# 6. Hooking and Modifying WalkSpeed Checks

Some games reset WalkSpeed to prevent speed exploits. We can hook it to stop that.

Example: Prevent WalkSpeed From Being Reset
```Lua
local old_setWS = hookfunction(game.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed, function(self, speed)
    print("Speed Hooked! Trying to set:", speed)
    if speed < 30 then return end -- Ignore any speed below 30
    return old_setWS(self, speed)
end)
```
If the game tries to reset WalkSpeed to normal, it will block it unless it’s above 30.

This keeps your speed exploit active!



---

# CONCLUSION: MASTER HOOKFUNCTION FOR FULL GAME CONTROL!

## With this advanced tutorial, you now know how to:
### Block RemoteEvents (prevent bans, disable logs)
### Modify RemoteFunction responses (fake money, change game data)
### Toggle hooks on/off (dynamic exploits, GUI control)
### Bypass anti-cheats (disable checks, avoid bans)
### Prevent forced WalkSpeed resets (speed exploits stay active)
