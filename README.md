HTTP Request Functions for Exploit Executors

When building exploit scripts in Lua, one of the most powerful features is making HTTP requests. Different executors (like Synapse X, Fluxus, Script-Ware, KRNL, and Electron) use different HTTP request functions. This tutorial explains how to automatically detect which function is available on the executor and how to use it to perform common tasks.

Detecting the Available HTTP Request Function

Different executors may expose one or more of these functions:

syn.request – (Synapse X)

request – (commonly available in KRNL/Electron)

http.request – (older method)

fluxus.request – (Fluxus executor)

pebc.request – (some mobile exploits)

The following code automatically picks the correct request function:

-- Automatically detect the working HTTP request function:
local http = syn and syn.request or 
             request or 
             http_request or 
             (http and http.request) or 
             (fluxus and fluxus.request) or 
             (krnl and krnl.request) or 
             (getgenv().request) or 
             error("No supported HTTP function found!")

-- Test the function with a GET request:
local response = http({
    Url = "https://httpbin.org/get",  -- Test API URL
    Method = "GET",
    Headers = {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"}
})

print(response.Body)  -- Should print the response data

This code uses logical OR operators to try each function until one is found. If none exists, it throws an error.

Sending a Discord Webhook Message

You can send a Discord webhook message by making a POST request with a custom JSON body. Here’s an example in Lua:

local webhook_url = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"

local data = {
    content = "sent a webhook message!",
    username = "Lua",  -- Custom name for this message
    avatar_url = "https://your-image-link-here.png"  -- Custom avatar (optional)
}

local response = http({
    Url = webhook_url,
    Method = "POST",
    Headers = {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"},
    Body = game:GetService("HttpService"):JSONEncode(data)
})

print(response.StatusCode)  -- Should be 200 if successful!

Note: This customizes the webhook name and avatar only for that request; it doesn’t permanently change the webhook’s settings.

Downloading a File

You can download a file from a URL and save it using writefile():

local url = "https://example.com/file.lua"  -- URL of the file you want to download
local response = http({ 
    Url = url, 
    Method = "GET" 
})

if response.StatusCode == 200 then
    writefile("downloaded_file.lua", response.Body)
    print("File Downloaded: downloaded_file.lua")
else
    print("Failed to Download")
end

This lets you automatically download and save scripts or assets.

Getting IP Address Information

To check IP details (for example, for logging or educational purposes), you can query a free API:

local response = http({
    Url = "http://ip-api.com/json/",
    Method = "GET"
})

local data = game:GetService("HttpService"):JSONDecode(response.Body)
print("IP Location: " .. data.country .. " (" .. data.city .. ")")
print("ISP: " .. data.isp)

Warning: Use this responsibly—do not misuse it for IP logging without consent.

Auto-Updating Scripts

You can make your script auto-update by downloading the latest version from a GitHub repository:

local url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourRepo/YourScript/main/script.lua"
local response = http({
    Url = url,
    Method = "GET"
})

if response.StatusCode == 200 then
    writefile("AutoUpdate.lua", response.Body)  -- Save the new version
    loadstring(response.Body)()  -- Execute the latest version
    print("Updated & Executed Latest Version!")
else
    print("Update Failed")
end

This ensures your script always runs the latest code from your GitHub repository.

Downloading and Executing Infinite Yield

You can also download and execute a popular admin script like Infinite Yield:

local response = http({
    Url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source",
    Method = "GET"
})

if response.StatusCode == 200 then
    loadstring(response.Body)()  -- Execute Infinite Yield
    print("Infinite Yield Loaded!")
else
    print("Failed to Load Infinite Yield")
end

This code automatically picks the correct function from the list, making your script work across different executors.

Notes & Limitations

Some executors block HTTP requests for security reasons.

Use game:GetService("HttpService"):JSONEncode() to encode tables into JSON strings.

Webhooks are rate-limited—avoid spamming them to prevent your messages from being blocked.
